## apipy

know what I am thinking about right now, with 99.99% accuracy.

### why?
- i want to port this to rust as a learning project. using rocket or whatever'll be easier to learn.
- i also want to port it to C and compile it to .wasm to learn web assembly
yeah, that is the plan.

api is on `app.py` and controller is on `main.py`
